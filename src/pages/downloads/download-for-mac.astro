  Audacity is tested on macOS 12 & 13, and may also work on any OS X version released after and including OS X 10.9 Mavericks. 
  Both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (ARM 64) versions are available, as well as a universal binary. There are no specific CPU or GPU requirements.

  **Note:** Audacity requires fast, uninterrupted access to a hard drive or SSD to operate. Network storage, consumer-grade external hard drives or USB thumbdrives may be unreliable.
