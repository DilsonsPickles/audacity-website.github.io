Hello everyone!

This is a quick note to let you know we updated our website. Audacity itself will get a new look soon-ish as well, though that is a herculean task which is better measured in years than weeks.

This new website no longer uses Wordpress, opting for a much more lightweight static site generator instead. Additionally, things have been slimmed down a bit. Old posts gotÂ [archived](https://archive.org/details/posts.audacity.WordPress.2023-09-11) and the page structure has been consolidated. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for this website in particular, feel free to raise an issue [on Github](https://github.com/audacity/audacity.github.io/issues). 

In the future, we want to translate this website into more languages, too. We'll let you know when we're opening up translations here. In the meantime, you can get involved in [translating Audacity](https://support.audacityteam.org/community/contributing/translating) if translation is your thing. If you'd rather help other users, you can do so in our [Forum](https://forum.audacityteam.org/) (which also has a new look as of earlier this year) or [on Discord](https://discord.gg/audacity).

And that's it! Let us know what you think!
