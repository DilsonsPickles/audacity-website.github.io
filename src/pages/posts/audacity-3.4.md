We are excited to announce Audacity 3.4, which adds the following features:

* **Beats and measures grid**: You can now easily align your audio clips to the musical tempo and rhythm of your project. The grid shows you the subdivisions of each measure depending on your zoom level, and you can snap your clips to the nearest beat. 

* **Time stretching**: You can now change the duration of your audio clips without affecting their pitch non-destructively. Audacity 3.4 uses a state-of-the-art algorithm that preserves the transients and harmonics of the original sound, while minimizing artifacts and distortion. You can [learn more about it here](audacity-3.4-timestretch.md).

You can download Audacity on [audacityteam.org/download](/download).
