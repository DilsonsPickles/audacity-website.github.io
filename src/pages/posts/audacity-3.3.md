## About Audacity 3.3
Audacity 3.3 is quite humble compared to our last releases. In terms of features, there's not too much to report:

* We added a linear dB ruler for waveforms. This ruler uses the standard convention found across the audio world. Meters and waveform now report the same values.
* We reworked the way snapping works. 
* We also started working on a Beats & Measures feature. It's not quite ready yet, so the coresponding toolbar is hidden by default. More information can be found [here](#)

Additional changes can be found in the [changelog](#).

## Why this happened

A lot of our work has been focused on getting Audacity ready for a version 4. As such, a lot of under-the-hood work has been happening - in technical terms: reducing dependency on wxWidgets, library extractions and general refactoring. This work will continue for the next few releases in parallel with feature development. 

We will share more information about Audacity 4 in a future post.
