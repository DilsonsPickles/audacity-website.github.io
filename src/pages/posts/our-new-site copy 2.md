Hello everyone!

This is a quick note to let you know we updated our website. As part of that, we have also updated the logo ever so slightly. Audacity itself will get a new look soon-ish as well, but unlike this website, that is a herculean task which is better measured in years than weeks.

In the future, we want to translate this website into more languages, too. We'll let you know when we're opening up translations here. In the meantime, you can check out [our transifex](LINK!) if you'd like to translate Audacity itself.

Let us know what you think in our (also recently upgraded!) [Forum](https://forum.audacityteam.org/...) or [on Discord](https://discord.gg/audacity).
